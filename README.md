# About Me
I am a junior at Boise State Univerity studying Computer Science. I am currently a Software Engineer Intern at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories. I am on our Device Configuration team and test new changes and additons to the Congfiguration software that is used for SEL Relay devices. I was born and raised here in Boise and I love the outdoors, mainly fishing, photography, and taking walks on the greenbelt!
